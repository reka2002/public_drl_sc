# Tartan V0.4: Production Planning Model

# Date: 15.05.2018

# V04 Updates: 
#   Time basis of model is set by production run rates. 
#   Refactor breaks out maintenance model for more modularity.
# V03 Updates: 
#   Adjust cost function to account for sales of late products and
#   to maximize profit as (sales - cost). 
#   Added flag to disable off-grade and another to remove restrictions
#   on weekend shipments.
#   Added containers to track late penalties, state, actions, etc.
#   This version introduced the Null action of 0 into the action 
#   space.
#   Adjusted return from the step function to only return the
#   schedule because rewards are logged in containers.
#   Updated the order generation function to properly account for the
#   shipment calendar and moved the function to a sub-module.

# This model is designed to simulate the basic dynamics and processes of an
# LDPE production system. There have been a number of simplifying assumptions
# to keep it tractable for current research goals. 
# The system runs with 24 hour time intervals.
# All batches take 24 hours to produce and 24 hours for curing time.
# The number of products is adjustable from 2 to n products.
# A scaling factor is used to determine the approximate volume of demand the
# system will experience in a simulated year with 1 indicating that supply is
# equal to demand. Values greater than 1 indicate more demand than supply and
# values less than one indicate excess capacity. This is a parameter to be 
# adjusted when generating orders.
